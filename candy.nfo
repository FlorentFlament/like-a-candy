* Notes *

Flush knitted this merry and colorful Atari VCS 4K intro;
sometimes life just tastes like a candy.
Welcome on board to Clou,
for her first graphics contribution,
to this tribute to Shadow of Genesis Project.

* Party notes *

Knitted on Atari 2600,
you know ... 1977 is not that old.
Still having fun with my tiny 128 bytes of ram.
